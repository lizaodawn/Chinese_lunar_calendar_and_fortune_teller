                    Fortune telling is said to have connections with one of the most ancient Chinese books, the <em>Yi
                    Ching</em>, where the concept of Yin and Yang came from.

                    <p class="text_content_c">&emsp;&emsp;The Chinese word for fortune teller means “one who counts
                        life”. The occupation of fortune-telling can be traced back to the beginning of civilization in
                        China. During the Shang Dynasty — the earliest governing dynasty of China established in
                        recorded history, leaders would practice divination by interpreting the pattern of cracks on a
                        burnt tortoise shell or the shoulder blade of an ox. It was a period in which divination was at
                        the forefront of decisions concerning the nation’s destiny. The rise of the Zhou Dynasty saw
                        perhaps the most influential inventions in the history of Chinese fortune-telling. Among these
                        innovations are trigrams, hexagrams, and a classic piece of literature in the field, the <em>I
                            Ching</em>, which can still be found in bookstores worldwide.

                    <p class="text_content_c">&emsp;&emsp;In traditional East Asian cultures, the ability to tell
                        fortunes is viewed as a gift—a way to help people make an accounting of life, interpret the
                        past, and make good decisions about the future. Although East Asian society may appear modern
                        and westernized on the surface, ancient and deeply held beliefs about divination are still
                        common. People look to fortune telling for answers concerning a wide variety of life events: a
                        loved one’s illness, starting a new business, passing college entrance exams, when to get
                        married, whether their unborn child will be healthy and successful. From morning to evening,
                        divination blocks are thrown, fortunes are drawn and deciphered, and offerings are made in the
                        hopes of a favorable outcome being revealed.

                        Others compliment their methods with deductions based on your reactions, appearance, etc. for
                        sometimes startling accuracy. In any case, prices are usually lower than in the West. One of the
                        benefits of fortune telling for some is its entertainment value, like the thrill of live magic,
                        or experiencing a real-life Sherlock Holmes try to read a person (you) at first sight. If the
                        soothsayer is good you may well hear a few home truths (that are deducible by a perceptive
                        person). A visit to a fortune teller might be as valuable as a visit to a psychologist or doctor
                        or religious advisor!
